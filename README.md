# Mini-Project-1

Description:
The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules.

We have covered HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and Figma at the end of Module 4.  Incorporate these skills into a mini project that you'd be proud to show off on your portfolio!

Consider a topic you feel strongly interested in, a hobby, an issue at work.  This could be in addition to your Capstone project.

Prepare and present a 10-minute presentation in class to get practice demonstrating and speaking about your work.

What to do:

•	Create Application Flow (Simple: landing page, login page, dashboard) <-- Write notes here first! Why are you doing it?
•	Generate a LoFi Figma
•	Code it up using HTML/CSS/JS, don't go overboard but make it nice.  Three pages will be the minimum.
•	Stretch Goal 1: HiFi Figma
•	Stretch Goal 2: Use design framework like Bootstrap
•	Stretch Goal 3: Add more pages, flesh out your app more (3 pages minimum)
•	Stretch Goal 4: Add charts using library <--- highly recommended to try

-----------
Rubric:
•	Detail of application flow, does it cover the general user flow?
•	Figma is fully fleshed out and designed well, are all pages and components included?
•	Code is structured properly, best practices, comments in code for future DEVs
•	Multiple branches, *DETAILED* PR requests
•	Quality of presentation - engaging, well structured, not too short or too long
